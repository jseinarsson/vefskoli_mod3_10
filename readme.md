* I use localStorage to run the login screen only once and store the name input in storage to be retrieved at a later date. Ideally, I would like to store the travel log entries as well, but have not had time to make that work yet.

* Navigating on the menu changes the url and the site uses popstates to change the content when the backward and forward in browser navigation is used. I cannot seem to get the URL to lead to the correct page however, always get a 404 error...
